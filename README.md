## Milestone 2a Feedback
* You only have one git commit for this phase.  Remember, commit and push often!
* Your wireframes are excellent, clearly laid out and clean.
* Your text description of the sections is nice and clear.
* You may want to consider giving a little less space to your header, on both mobile and desktop.  If you want to give the title that much space, consider a Hero Image or similar to give people something to look at rather than only floating text.
* You probably should have some kind of footer, even if it's a simple copyright date, so that users know that they've reached the end of the page.
* Menus are often unnecessary on a single page site.  Consider if you really need it, or if it's going to be more trouble than it's worth.

Overall, this is very good work.  Your work is clear and concise, and shows what your plan is.  You have a few small things about your wireframes you should think about, and your git commit history should be a bit more bite-sized.  In total, this sets you up well for your next phase of your project, and you are well situated to succeed going forward.  

Your overall grade is a Tier III.
